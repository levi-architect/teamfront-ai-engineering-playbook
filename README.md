# 🧠 Teamfront AI Engineering Playbook  
### *The Standard for AI-Accelerated Engineering Across All Teamfront Product Companies*

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Teamfront AI Engineering Playbook** is the unified, end-to-end operating system for how engineering teams across all TeamCo companies build modern software in the AI era.

This playbook defines:

- How we design  
- How we architect  
- How we write code  
- How we modernize old systems  
- How we integrate AI into every workflow  
- How we deliver 2–4× faster with 70% fewer defects  

This is the engineering blueprint for:

- Arborgold
- Floorzapp  
- Xcelerate  
- ServiceMonster  
- WikiPro  
- Fieldster  
- All future Teamfront product initiatives  

It is **tool-agnostic**, AI-native, and grounded in proven architectural patterns (DDD, CQRS, vertical slices).

---

## 🧩 Purpose

This Playbook exists to:

- Standardize engineering practices across all teams  
- Accelerate modernization across Teamfront products  
- Enable rapid onboarding of new engineers  
- Reduce architectural drift  
- Ensure FE/BE coherence in AI-generated code  
- Codify the AI-accelerated development model  
- Provide leadership with a repeatable, scalable engineering operating model  

This is **Teamfront’s Engineering Operating System**.

## 📚 Contents

This repository contains the core manuals, standards, and frameworks that define the AI-first engineering culture:

### **Core Documents**

- **Teamfront AI Engineering Manifesto**  
  Vision, transformation, and the next 900 days.

- **AI IDE (.e.g. Cursor) Development Framework**  
  PRD → Design Doc → Cursor Execution workflow.

- **AI Figma → Builder → MCP Framework**  
  Modern design-to-frontend pipeline for accelerated UI builds.

- **AI Design → Backend Integration Guide**  
  How UI → API → Domain Wiring is done using AI IDEs.

- **Backend Engineering Standards (Teamfront)**  
  DDD, CQRS, layering, handler patterns, repository structure.

- **Frontend Engineering Standards (Teamfront)**  
  FE slice patterns, state management, props, routing, UI best practices.

## 🔥 Why “AI Engineering Playbook”?

Because this is **not** a documentation folder.

It is a **repeatable engineering system**:

- A blueprint CTOs can apply to every TeamCo product  
- A playbook PE leadership can use to scale engineering  
- A system engineers can use to deliver features 10× faster  
- A shared language for architecture, design, and execution  
- An operating model that aligns design, product, and engineering  
- A standardized workflow for AI-accelerated development  

This Playbook is the foundation for the next decade of engineering at Teamfront.

## 🛠 AI-Accelerated Engineering Workflow

Teamfront engineering now operates through:

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**  
2. **Design & Architecture Document**  
3. **Cursor (or any AI IDE) Execution Plan**  
4. **FE + BE opened together in the AI IDE**  
5. **Full-stack vertical slice generation**  
6. **Human review through GitHub Desktop**  
7. **Automated PR summaries and iteration**

This is the new operating model.

## 🏁 The Future

AI is not replacing engineers.  
AI is **multiplying** engineers.

This Playbook ensures Teamfront stays:

- Faster than competitors  
- More consistent than legacy orgs  
- More scalable than siloed teams  
- More modern than any field-service platform in the market  

The next 900 days will define the next 20 years.

This Playbook is how we lead.
