⚙️ AI IDE Development Framework
The Standard PRD → Design Doc → Execution Workflow for AI-Accelerated Engineering
🧠 I. Overview

The AI IDE Development Framework defines how Teamfront engineers design, model, and build modern software using AI IDEs such as Cursor, Antigravity, Claude Code, Continue.dev, Windsurf, and Amazon Q.

This framework is tool-agnostic and focuses on creating repeatable, predictable, domain-driven, AI-accelerated development across all Teamfront product companies.

📝 II. How PRDs Are Created in the AI Era

PRDs are never written manually.
They are generated from real conversations.

PRD Creation Workflow

Record the meeting (Zoom + Fathom).
Export the transcript.
Paste the transcript into ChatGPT.
Ask ChatGPT to extract:

Summary

Problem

Goals

Non-goals

Personas (Admins, Estimators, Technicians, Owners)

Requirements

Edge cases

Success metrics

Risks

Save as:

/docs/<feature>/PRD.md

The PRD defines WHAT we are building.

🏗️ III. How Design / Architecture Docs Are Created

The PRD answers WHAT.
The Design Doc answers HOW.

The Design Doc is generated by ChatGPT based on the PRD.

Each Design Doc must define:
Domain Modeling

Entities

Value Objects

Aggregates

Domain Events

Invariants

Relationships

Application Layer

Commands

Queries

Validators

Vertical slice boundaries

API Layer

Endpoints

Request DTOs

Response DTOs

System Constraints

Business rules

Error handling

Performance requirements

Permissions

Save as:

/docs/<feature>/DESIGN.md

📁 IV. Required Folder Structure

Every feature must follow:

/docs
/<feature>/
   PRD.md
   DESIGN.md
   EXECUTION_PLAN.md


This standardizes how AI interprets requirements.

📘 V. Execution Plan (AI IDE Instructions)

The Execution Plan tells the AI IDE exactly how to build the feature.

Save as:

/docs/<feature>/EXECUTION_PLAN.md

The Execution Plan Defines:

Phase order

What is built in each phase

Naming conventions

Slice sequencing

Stop points

FE ↔ BE alignment rules

Acceptance criteria

🛠️ VI. AI IDE Build Phases
⚙️ Phase 1 — Backend Foundations (NO logic)

Generate:

Entities

Aggregates

Value Objects

Domain Events

Repositories

Commands

Queries

Validators

Mappers

Empty Controllers

Stop when scaffolding is complete.

🖥️ Phase 2 — Frontend Foundations

Generate:

Routes

Screens

Forms

Tables

Modals

TS interfaces

Empty API services

No business logic yet.

🔗 Phase 3 — FE ↔ BE Wiring

DTO ↔ TS interface syncing

Service → Controller mapping

Type alignment

Error format consistency

Eliminates contract drift.

🧠 Phase 4 — Domain Logic + UX Behavior

Implement:

Totals

Taxes

Validation

Payment logic

Error states

UX flows

Loading states

🎨 Phase 5 — Polish

Add:

Sorting

Filtering

Pagination

Search

Loading skeletons

Empty states

PDF/Email actions

Tests

🧾 VII. Invoice Domain Example
Entities

Invoice

InvoiceLineItem

InvoiceTotals

Transaction

TaxRate

📐 Invoice Vertical Slices

CreateInvoice

AddLineItem

RemoveLineItem

RecalculateTotals

FinalizeInvoice

GetInvoice

ListInvoices

transaction/

InitiateTransaction

ApplyPayment

GetTransaction

ListTransactions

tax/

GetTaxRate

CalculateTax

integration.email/

SendInvoiceEmail

🚀 VIII. Invoice Execution Plan Summary
Phase 1 – Backend Foundations

Entities, DTOs, Commands, Handlers, Validators, Repositories, Empty Controllers.

Phase 2 – Frontend Foundations

Screens, forms, lists, interfaces, empty services.

Phase 3 – Wiring

Connect UI to API and sync DTOs.

Phase 4 – Domain Logic

Totals, taxes, validations.

Phase 5 – Final Polish

Filtering, sorting, PDF, actions.

⭐ IX. Why This Framework Wins

AI automates execution

Humans enforce architecture

Eliminates FE/BE drift

Features ship 3–5× faster

Consistent across all Teamfront companies

Perfect for modernization and new features

This is the Teamfront AI-First Engineering Operating System.
