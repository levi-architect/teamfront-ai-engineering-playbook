# ⚙️ AI IDE Development Framework  
### *PRD → Design Doc → Execution in the AI Engineering Era*

---

## 🚀 1. Introduction

This framework defines how Teamfront engineers design, model, and build software using  
AI IDEs (e.g., Cursor, Antigravity, Claude Code, Windsurf, Continue.dev, Amazon Q).

It is **tool-agnostic** and focuses on the principles that make AI-accelerated engineering  
repeatable, predictable, and scalable across all Teamfront product companies.

## 🧠 2. The AI-First Engineering Workflow

**Conversations → Transcripts → AI → PRD → Design Doc → AI IDE Execution → Shipping**

1. Meetings are recorded  
2. Fathom transcript is exported  
3. ChatGPT converts transcript → PRD  
4. ChatGPT converts PRD → Design/Architecture Doc  
5. AI IDE executes vertical slices  
6. Engineers refine & validate  
7. Feature ships end-to-end  

This replaces manual writing, reduces drift, and compresses weeks → days.

## 📝 3. PRDs Should NEVER Be Written by Hand

PRDs come from **transcripts**, not imagination.

### Process
1. Paste Fathom transcript into ChatGPT  
2. Ask for:  
   - Summary  
   - Problems  
   - Goals  
   - Personas (Field Service: office staff, techs, admins, estimators)  
   - Requirements  
   - Edge cases  
   - Success metrics  
   - Risks  

3. Save as:
